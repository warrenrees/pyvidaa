## Troubleshooting

### TV not discovered

1. Make sure the TV is powered on (not in standby)
2. Ensure the TV and Home Assistant are on the same network/VLAN
3. Check that SSDP/UPnP is enabled on your router
4. Try manual setup with the TV's IP address

### PIN not appearing on TV

1. Make sure the TV screen is on (not in screensaver mode)
2. Try pressing a button on the TV remote to wake it
3. Restart the TV and try again
4. Check if there's a "Remote App" or "Mobile App" setting in TV settings

### Connection lost after reboot

The integration stores authentication tokens that should persist across reboots. If you experience issues:

1. Check that the TV's IP address hasn't changed (consider setting a static IP or DHCP reservation)
2. Remove and re-add the integration if tokens have expired

### Wake-on-LAN not working

1. Enable Wake-on-LAN in your TV's network settings
2. Make sure the TV is connected via Ethernet (not WiFi) for best WoL support
3. Some TV models don't support WoL

### Commands not working

1. Make sure the TV is fully booted (wait 30 seconds after power on)
2. Try refreshing the entity state
3. Check Home Assistant logs for error messages

## Debug Logging

Enable debug logging for more detailed information:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.vidaa_tv: debug
    pyvidaa: debug
```

## Known Limitations

- Some older Hisense TVs may not be compatible
- Wake-on-LAN depends on TV model and network configuration
- App IDs may vary between TV models/regions
- Some TVs may disconnect after period of inactivity
